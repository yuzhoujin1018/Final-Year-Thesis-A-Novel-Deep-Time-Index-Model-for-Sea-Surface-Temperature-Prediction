# Final Year Thesis: A Novel Deep Time-Index Model for Sea Surface Temperature Prediction


This is my final year thesis, referred by a time index model framework proposed in ICML 2023 and dual attention.

* Implemented an innovative time-indexed neural network model using PyTorch, which utilized timestamps as direct inputs to predict Sea Surface Temperature values, diverging from traditional historical sequence-based models.
* Incorporated a Fourier feature layer to capture periodic patterns effectively and a dual-attention mechanism to enhance the model's focus on critical temporal features, improving overall predictive performance.
* Achieved a 20% reduction in mean training error and accelerated training time by 30% compared to state-of-the-art sequence models like Informer and Autoformer, demonstrating superior efficiency and accuracy.
